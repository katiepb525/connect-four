# connect-four
Connect four. Acclimating myself to TDD.
Rsoec feels like learning programming all over again. Definetely not without purpose, though. This project helped me figure out the boundary between unit testing and integration testing. 

Known problems: If you select a full column, it will skip your turn. Maybe I will make a #column_full? method later. Just looking to meet minimum requirements for now, though.
